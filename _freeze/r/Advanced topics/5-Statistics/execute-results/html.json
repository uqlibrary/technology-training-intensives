Recall that linear regressions have the mathematical form\n\n$$ Y = β_1 X + β_0 $$\n\nwhere $β_1$ is the **slope** (or gradient) of the line and $β_0$ the y-intercept. We use the regression tool to estimate the parameters $β_0\\,,β_1$. \n\nA linear model (like above) is one example of the more general relationship $Y\\sim X$, where $Y$ *is distributed as* $X$ (or, $Y$ *depends on* $X$). For this reason, we can construct a linear model in R with three pieces of information\n\n* The type of model (e.g. linear) as a function (e.g. `lm(...)`)\n* The general relationship between variables as a string (e.g. `\"height_cm ~ age\"`)\n* The dataset we're using (e.g. `players`)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlm(formula = \"height_cm ~ age\", data = players)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = \"height_cm ~ age\", data = players)\n\nCoefficients:\n(Intercept)          age  \n  182.38260      0.02583  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n# R formula syntax\n\nPerforming statistical modelling with R inevitably requires using R's powerful formula syntax, as we just did with `\"height_cm ~ age\". For anything beyond simple linear regressions, you'll need to include more terms and operators in these. Here's a quick summary of a few, but [you should check out this handy blog post](https://www.econometrics.blog/post/the-r-formula-cheatsheet/) for a better summary and the [official documentation](https://search.r-project.org/R/refmans/stats/html/formula.html) for comprehensive details.\n\n```r\n~\n```\n\nUse `~` to separate the $Y$ variable from the $X$ variable(s), e.g. `y ~ x`.\n\n```r\n+\n```\n\nAdd multiple $X$ variables, e.g. `y ~ x + z` (for variable `z`)\n\n```r\n:\n```\n\nConsider the *interaction* between two variables, e.g. `y ~ x:z`.\n\n```r\n-\n```\n\nRemove variables, e.g. `y ~ x - 1` (removes the intercept).\n\n:::\n\nIf we store this as a variable, we can then produce a summary of the results (note that we can remove the `formula = ` and `data = ` if the order is correct),\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel <- lm(\"height_cm ~ age\", players)\nsummary(model)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = \"height_cm ~ age\", data = players)\n\nResiduals:\n    Min      1Q  Median      3Q     Max \n-23.028  -5.028   0.075   4.978  23.075 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

We'll need to use techniques from the visualisation session. Let's import **ggplot2**\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n```\n:::\n\n\nStart by making a scatterplot of the data,\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(players, aes(x = height_cm, y = age)) +\n  geom_point()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](5-Statistics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThen, you'll need to plot the regression as a line. For reference,\n\n$$ y = \\text{slope}\\times x + \\text{intercept}$$\n\nSo\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nb0 <- model$coefficients[1]\nb1 <- model$coefficients[2]\n\nggplot(players, aes(x = age, y = height_cm)) + \n    geom_point() + \n    geom_abline(intercept = b0, slope = b1)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](5-Statistics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-22-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### $t$-tests\n\nWe can also perform $t$-tests. Typically, these are performed to examine the statistical signficance of a difference between two samples' means. Let's examine whether that earlier groupby result for is accurate for heights, specifically, **are goalkeepers taller than non-goalkeepers?**\n\nLet's start by creating a new column with the values\n \n| | | \n| --- | --- |\n| `FALSE` | Non-goalkeeper | \n| `TRUE` | Goalkeeper | \n \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplayers <- players %>% \n  mutate(gk = positions == \"Goalkeeper\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe $t$-test's goal is to check whether $\\text{height\\_cm}$ depends on $\\text{gk}$, so the formula is $\\text{height\\_cm}\\sim\\text{gk}$. This is given to the `t.test` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nt.test(height_cm ~ gk, data = players)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tWelch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  height_cm by gk\nt = -48.817, df = 1274.4, p-value < 2.2e-16\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group FALSE and group TRUE is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -9.036644 -8.338391\nsample estimates:\nmean in group FALSE  mean in group TRUE \n           181.9810            190.6685 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYielding a p-value of $p<2.2\\times10^{-16}$, indicating that the null-hypothesis (*heights are the same*) is extremely unlikely.\n\nTo visualise this result, it might be helpful to produce a histogram of the heights\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(players, \n       aes(x = height_cm, fill = gk)) + \n  geom_histogram(bins = 24)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](5-Statistics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### ANOVAs\n\nWhat about the means of the other three? We could use an ANOVA to examine them. We use the `aov()` function for this. \n\nLet's start by making a new dataset without goalkeepers\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nno_gk <- players %>% filter(gk == FALSE)\n```\n:::\n\n\nNext, we save the analysis of variance results\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nres_aov <- aov(height_cm ~ positions, data = no_gk)\n```\n:::\n\n\nAnd examine them with `summary()`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(res_aov)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n              Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)    \npositions      2  15470    7735   199.7 <2e-16 ***\nResiduals   5205 201552      39                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEven without goalkeepers included, it looks like their positions are not all independent of height.\n\n### $\\chi^2$ tests\n\n$χ^2$ tests are useful for examining the relationship of categorical variables by comparing the frequencies of each. Often, you'd use this if you can make a contingency table.\n\nWe only have one useful categorical variable here, \"positions\" (the others have too many unique values), so we'll need to create another. Let's see if there's a relationship between players' positions and names with the letter \"a\".\n\nMake a binary column for players with the letter \"a\" in their names. To do this, we need to apply a string method to *all* the columns in the dataframe as follows\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplayers <- players %>%\n  mutate(a_in_name = grepl(\"a\", name))\n```\n:::\n\n\n> The `grepl` function perform pattern matching: it checks if the pattern `\"a\"` is inside the values in `name`.\n\nLet's cross tabulate positions with this new column\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(players$positions, players$a_in_name)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n            \n             FALSE TRUE\n  Attack       291 1280\n  Defender     355 1606\n  Goalkeeper   149  575\n  Midfield     312 1364\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe $χ^2$ test's job is to examine whether players' positions depend on the presence of \"a\" in their name. To evaluate it we need to send the contingency table in:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nchisq.test(table(players$positions, players$a_in_name))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n\tPearson's Chi-squared test\n\ndata:  table(players$positions, players$a_in_name)\nX-squared = 2.1808, df = 3, p-value = 0.5357\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs expected, there is no signifcant relationship. A simple bar plot can help us here\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(players,\n       aes(x = positions, fill = a_in_name)) + \n  geom_bar()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](5-Statistics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIf we use the `position = \"fill\"` parameter to `geom_bar`, we'll see each as a proportion\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(players,\n       aes(x = positions, fill = a_in_name)) + \n  geom_bar(position = \"fill\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](5-Statistics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-33-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIt looks as though the proportions are much the same.\n\n### Generalised linear models\n\nWe'll finish by looking at Generalised Linear Models. The distributions they include are\n\n* Binomial\n* Poisson\n* Gaussian (Normal)\n* Gamma\n* Inverse Gaussian\n* A few *quasi* options\n\nWe'll use the *binomial* option to create logistic regressions.\n\nLogistic regressions examine the distribution of binary data. For us, we can compare the heights of **goalkeepers vs non-goalkeepers** again. \n\nNow, we can model this column with height. We'll do the same as our $t$-test case, but this time we need to specify that `family = binomial` to ensure we'll get a logistic:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nres_logistic <- glm(gk ~ height_cm, family = binomial, data = players)\n```\n:::\n\n\nWe can take a look at the results with\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsummary(res_logistic)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = gk ~ height_cm, family = binomial, data = players)\n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

We need to make *another* variable, because we need to replace `TRUE` $\\rightarrow$ `1` and `FALSE` $\\rightarrow$ `0` for the plot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplayers <- players %>% mutate(gk_numeric = as.numeric(gk))\n```\n:::\n\n\nNow we can plot the logistic regression. The fitted values (on the $y$-axis) are stored in `res_logistic$fitted.values`, but there are no provided $x$-values - these come from the `players` dataset. Use `geom_point()` for the data and `geom_line()` for the fit:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nggplot(players, aes(x = height_cm, y = gk_numeric)) + \n  geom_point() + \n  geom_line(aes(y = res_logistic$fitted.values))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](5-Statistics_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-37-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n",
