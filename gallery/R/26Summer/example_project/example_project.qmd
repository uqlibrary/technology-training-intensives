```{R}
#| code-summary: "Set up code"
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(plotly)
library(knitr)

players_raw <- read.csv("../../../../data/Players2024.csv")
```

## A glimpse at the dataset

We'll begin just by taking a glimpse at the dataset:
```{R}
kable(head(players_raw))
```

## Cleaning the data
The data has a few issues, as the following plot shows:

```{R}
ggplot(players_raw, aes(x = positions, y = height_cm)) +
  geom_boxplot() 

#sns.catplot(df_raw, x = "positions", y = "height_cm")
```

It looks like some of the players' positions and heights were recorded incorrectly. To clean, let's remove the "Missing" positions and ensure that heights are reasonable:

```{R}
#| code-fold: show
# Remove missing position and ensure reasonable heights
players <- players_raw %>% filter(positions != "Missing", height_cm > 100)
```

To confirm, let's plot the outliers in a different colour

```{R}
# Identify outliers
outliers <- anti_join(players_raw, players)

# Plot
ggplot(players, aes(x = positions, y = height_cm)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  geom_point(data = outliers, colour = "red")
```

## Visualising the players' heights

After cleaning the data we can now analyse the players' heights to see if there's differences between positions. Let's make the boxplot without the outliers

```{R}
ggplot(players, aes(x = positions, y = height_cm)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Position", y = "Height (cm)") 

ggsave("tb.png")
```

It looks like goalkeepers are taller than the rest! 

Let's through the age variable into the mix, to see if players' heights allow them to compete longer.

```{R}
#| title: Age vs Height

p <- ggplot(players, aes(x = age, y = height_cm, colour = positions, label = name, label2 = nationality)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(vars(positions)) + 
  labs(x = "Age", colour = "Position", y = "Height (cm)")

ggplotly(p)
```

It doesn't look like there's a relationship between heights and ages, but clearly it affects their position!

## Global spread

We haven't looked at the nationality column yet. Let's draw up a map using plotly to see where the players come from. 

```{R}

# Change country names to match plotly reference
players <- players %>% 
  mutate(nationality = case_match(nationality,
                                  "England" ~ "United Kingdom",
                                  "Türkiye" ~ "Turkey",
                                  "Cote d'Ivoire" ~ "Ivory Coast",
                                  "Northern Ireland" ~ "United Kingdom",
                                  "Wales" ~ "United Kingdom",
                                  .default = nationality))
    
# Make the country count
countries <- players %>%
  group_by(nationality) %>%
  summarise(n = n())

# Make the plot
countries %>% 
  plot_ly(type = "choropleth", 
          locations = countries$nationality, 
          locationmode = "country names", 
          z = countries$n) %>%
  colorbar(title = "# of Players")

```
